He is the founder of The Unicist Research Institute that has been a pioneer in complexity science research since 1976 and is now a world leader in its segment. He is the creator of the unicist theory of functionality. This theory affirms and demonstrates that there is nothing in the universe, which is part of a system, that does not work with a purpose, an active and entropic function, and an energy conservation function. It provides the basics of the functionalist approach to deal with sciences, technologies, and businesses.The unicist functionalist approach drove the development of binary actions, catalysts, unicist AI, collaborative robots (cobots), and functional design to increase the effectiveness and adaptability of business processes.  He led to more than 5000 applied research projects focused on the development of unicist functional technologies in the field of social, economic, business, and individual evolution.These developments were based on the discovery of the ontogenetic intelligence of nature that allowed developing the unicist logic and apply it to science and technology. The unicist logic allowed developing the fundamentals-based AI that is based on the use of the ontogenetic maps of the concepts and fundamentals.His scientific works have been synthesized in more than 150 books that integrate the “Unicist Library”, which provides concepts and fundamentals that define the solutions to manage the unified field of adaptive systems and environments. These works drove to the creation of The Unicist School with 100,000+ followers in 56 countries.He has been developing philanthropic activities for decades fostering the introduction of a constructivist mindset for adolescents and young people both at a personal and social level.

Of course, we need to use renewable sources of energy, but more out of a need to reduce the harmful gases that are a by-product of burning coal/petroleum than out of fear of them running out. This need is urgent and important. The major problem with these renewable sources of energy is that they are inherently intermittent- the sun does not shine all day long etc. Energy storage can, succinctly, solve this issue, and will be the key towards determining how popular renewables can be. Batteries will be the most convenient energy storage, mostly because a great amount of energy can be stored chemically in a small space.With this in mind, I began my Ph.D. in a new type of battery which I believe has the potential to usher in this new age of renewables- the sodium-ion battery. Sodium-based compounds are inexpensive and globally abundant. Research indications are that these batteries can surpass/be comparable with lithium-ion batteries in performance. This would mean that the sodium-ion battery has the potential to be a one-stop battery for two very important applications- grid storage and electric vehicle application. After completing my Ph.D., I worked towards scaling-up my research to show viable industry-scale ""18650"" sodium-ion batteries during my Postdoctoral position from September 2015 - December 2017. I successfully invented a new Fe-based cathode and developed a non-flammable liquid non-aqueous electrolyte. Using these two inventions, we demonstrated various full cell configurations at the 18650-level. I also developed a new battery concept with potential for high energy density, the in-situ sodium plated battery, and also worked towards developing the hybrid Mg-Na battery concept. Since March 2018, I have been working at Faradion Limited to help commercialise sodium-ion batteries.",Research Fellow;at National;University of;Singapore 2;yrs 4;mos Ph.D.;in Sodium-Ion;Batteries at;the Department;of Mechanical;Engineering at;National University;of Singapore;4 yrs;1 mo;,National University of Singapore;Degree Name Doctor of Philosophy (PhD);Field Of Study Sodium-ion Battery;Dates attended or expected graduation 2011 – 2015

It kills the microorganisms on the surface of the produce and improves food safety.  This work resulted in a patent and a USDA research grant.In my five years at Kellogg, I gained a broad cross-category technical and professional experience. I joined the Cereal team and led innovation, renovation and cost optimization projects from concept creation to commercialization. Concurrently, I managed the fortification of the entire RTEC portfolio to conform with revised labeling requirements and deliver over $1,000,000 in cost savings, a huge project involving strategic collaboration between internal and external partners. I represented R&D at the Global Kellogg fortification suppliers selection meeting and served as the global fortification subject matter expert for Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Canada. I also wrote the chapter on vitamin fortification for the new edition of ""Breakfast Cereals, and How They are Made"".I led several innovation projects developing food for different customers including schools and the military. These projects involved concept testing, prototype making, cross-functional interaction for decision-making, plant testing, start-up runs at the plant and launching. Building strong collaborative relationship with Marketing, Nutrition, Regulatory, Quality, Chemistry, Sensory, Statistics, outside suppliers and Manufacturing was key to the success of these projects, which included graham crackers, frozen pancakes, frozen waffles, pastry crisps and cold-form bars. Recently, I applied for a patent on protein incorporation into batter systems, overcoming the clumping of the conventional method and introducing a novel approach to adding high levels of protein in batters with no effect on processing. I am a passionate and creative food scientist who conducts work independently and consistently delivers excellent results. I am proactive, agile, and drive engagement and positivity in projects.

My driving interest in bench to bedside development of therapeutics began at Purdue University, where my research in the areas of fibrosis, inflammation, wound healing, and tissue remodeling resulted in 4 peer reviewed publications and 6 conference proceedings. Actively participating in Purdue NSF I-Corps as the Entrepreneurial Lead for a mock start-up, I interviewed over 70 professionals in the healthcare industry to validate a business model canvas for an autologous biologic skin substitute based on surgeon needs. This lean launchpad course spiked my interest in working at the interface of pipeline lead and discovery and clinical drug development to eventually advance needs based innovative therapies into the clinic.To pursue my interest in early stage drug discovery, I interned at a start-up focused on developing matrix targeted biotherapeutics. I loved being a part of the cross-functional and fast-paced scientific research team and contributing significantly to research that resulted in tangible clinical progress. My work included generating mechanism of action and preclinical data for advancing therapeutics in 3 separate disease indications - cardiovascular diseases, osteoarthritis, and fibrosis. Next, I continued to expand my translational expertise as a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Davis. My work there involved developing new candidate therapies for ischemic wound healing, as well as drug development for the prevention of restenosis and neointimal hyperplasia following balloon angioplasty, both of which have advanced into in vivo proof of concept studies. This work resulted in 8 publications and 4 conference proceedings. I'm currently working at Ambys Medicines as a Cell Therapy Scientist for their liver regeneration platform.

I am primarily focused on developing novel and effective immunotherapy for cancer. I have experience with various types of immunotherapy, including T cell receptor TCR-T cell therapy, chimeric antigen receptor CAR-NKT or CAR-T cell therapy, as well as virus-like particle (VLP) and nanoparticle-based vaccines. T cell therapies to-date have achieved incredible success in treating liquid cancers like lymphomas and leukemias. However, their efficacies in treating solid tumors remain to be seen. One of the strategies to improving cell-based immunotherapy is to develop specifically-designed therapies targeting common genetic driver mutations or patient-specific gene mutations in the tumor. I am currently working on the development of specialized T cell receptor-based T cell therapy (TCR-T) targeted towards neoantigens generated by these types of mutations.As a doctorate scientist by training, I enjoy problem solving and gaining meaningful insights on interesting biological phenomena.
